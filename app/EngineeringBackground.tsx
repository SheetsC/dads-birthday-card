          <br/> This year Emily and I had to be creative with our gifts.
          <br/> We are so appreciative for all you do for us 
          <br/> and wanted to honor you in a lasting way 
          <br/> This card will be around forever *or until my deployment runs out* 
          <br/> I hope you find it useful as well as sentimental
